# Blog — What I Learned in Week 1 of Prompt Engineering
**Author:** Malaika  
**Date:** 2025-08-29

## 1) Why Prompt Structure Matters
I tested Role • Task • Context • Format. It forced clarity and produced cleaner results I could reuse.

## 2) Zero‑Shot vs Few‑Shot
Adding 2–3 examples improved consistency for sentiment tasks and reduced ambiguity.

## 3) Role‑Based Prompting
Switching roles (Teacher, Lawyer, Marketer) proved how tone and constraints change outputs without changing the product.

## 4) Structured Steps (Concise)
Encouraging brief steps produced more transparent reasoning without being too long.

## 5) Self‑Reflection Loop
Draft → Critique → Improve made marketing copy noticeably tighter.
