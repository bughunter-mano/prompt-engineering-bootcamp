## 2) Critique Prompt (act as a reviewer)
Critique the draft above. In bullets, list:
- What’s unclear
- What’s repetitive
- Missing benefits or social proof
- 2 headline options

**Critique Output:*2) Critique Prompt
Unclear: The description of "smart reminders" and "revision quizzes" is a bit vague. It doesn't clearly explain how they are smart or personalized.

Repetitive: The phrase "academic goals" is redundant after mentioning boosting grades. The sentence "get ready to boost your grades and learn smarter" feels like a soft repeat of the first sentence.

Missing benefits: It doesn't highlight the outcome of using the app beyond just grades—like feeling less stressed, saving time, or truly understanding a topic. There's no social proof.

Missing social proof: The statement "join thousands of other students" is okay, but it could be stronger by giving a specific number, such as "trusted by over 50,000 students."
