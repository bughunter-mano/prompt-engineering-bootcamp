# Day 5 — Structured Steps vs No Steps
**Decision Task:** Choose the better 1‑week study plan for a student with 2 hours/day who has Math exam in 10 days and weak algebra fundamentals.

## A) Prompt without steps
Recommend the best plan in one paragraph.

**Output A:*A) Prompt without steps
The best plan for a student with a math exam in 10 days and weak algebra skills is one that prioritizes a focused review of fundamental concepts. A daily two-hour block should be dedicated to a mix of targeted algebra practice and spaced repetition of more advanced topics. By starting with the basics and gradually integrating new material, the student can build a strong foundation, which is crucial for tackling the exam's more complex problems. This approach ensures they are not just memorizing formulas but truly understanding the underlying principles.*

## B) Prompt with structured, concise steps (encourage reasoning, but brief)
Recommend the best plan. Then list **5 numbered, concise steps** explaining why this plan beats alternatives (focus, sequencing, spaced practice, review). Keep steps under 12 words each.

**Output B:*The best plan is a focused, daily regimen that tackles core algebra topics first.

Focus: Directly address the weak point: algebra fundamentals.

Sequencing: Build from basic concepts to more complex ones.

Spaced Practice: Spread out learning over several days.

Review: Dedicate time each day to review older topics.

Efficiency: Optimize 2-hour daily blocks for maximum learning.*

## Reflection (2–3 lines)
How did step structure change clarity?
The structured steps in the second prompt significantly improved clarity by forcing me to break down the reasoning into discrete, easy-to-digest points. Instead of a single paragraph explaining the entire strategy, the numbered list created a clear, logical progression of thought that was easier for the user to follow and understand.
